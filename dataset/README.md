- `processed_data/llm_categorized_dataset.json`: Policy translation dataset where policy category is predicted by LLM. This dataset is generated by `dataset_categorizer.py` script.

- `processed_data/manually_categorized_dataset.json`: Policy translation dataset where policy category is provided by human. This is a `JSON` file tranformed from the original `CSV` file (`processed_data/dataset.csv`).

 - `raw_data/category_definitions.json`: Definitions of the categories. This is used by `dataset_categorizer.py` script to categorize the policies in dataset using LLM.

 - `raw_data/policy_grammar.ebnf`: Grammar of the policy language in `EBNF` format. This is used in experiment config as knowledge base for LLM.

 - `raw_data/policy_tutorial.md`: Detailed tutorial of the policy language. This is used in experiment config as knowledge base for LLM.

 - `raw_data/policy_tutorial_simplified.md`: Simplified tutorial of the policy language. This is used in experiment config as knowledge base for LLM.

- `raw_data/policy_tutorial_summarized.md`: Summarized tutorial of the policy language. This is used in experiment config as knowledge base for LLM.

**Note**: The category names in the dataset are different than what we used in the paper. The mapping of the category names from paper to dataset is describe in [Cateogry Mapping](./paper_names_to_repo_names_map.md).
